# Deeplearning
This is my study record.
*** 
### 1. Overview  
I've been learning Python for two years now. I thought I'd post some of the material I studied and practiced when I first started learning. I know this won't help anyone reading this because you all have great skills, but I'm uploading this git to keep a record of my learning.  

### 2. Study contents  
- basic pytorch
- NLP
- analysis tabular data

### 3. Conclusion
I was able to learn the basics of deep learning and NLP. I hope to build on this foundation and create something great in the future.
